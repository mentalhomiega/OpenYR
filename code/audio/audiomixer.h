// The mixer. A fixed pool of voices reads clips and streams, resamples them
// to the output rate, applies the voice, group and master levels and the pan,
// and sums them. Render is a pure function of the commands received and the
// frames asked for, so it runs the same on a device thread, on the feeder
// thread while a device is being recovered, and in a test.
