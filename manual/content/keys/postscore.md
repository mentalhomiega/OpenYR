The movie plays after the score screen and before [`PreMapSelect`](/keys/premapselect/). It still plays when [`SkipScore`](/keys/skipscore/) hides the score screen. Neither the score screen nor the movie appears while a recorded game is played back.

[`Intro`](/keys/intro/) covers how a movie name is resolved and what happens to one that cannot be found.
