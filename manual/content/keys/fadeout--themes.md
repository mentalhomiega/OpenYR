`FadeOut=` in THEME.INI's `[General]` section sets how many seconds the current music track takes to fade out when it gives way to a queued track, when the player presses Stop on the sound options screen, when a mission is won, lost, restarted or left, and when the game fades the music out on leaving a menu. A queued track starts once the fade has ended. The music also takes this long to fall to [`IonStormVolume=`](/keys/ionstormvolume/) when an ion storm starts its storm sound, and to rise again when the storm ends.

```ini title="theme01.ini"
[General]
FadeOut=3
```

`0` stops the track at once. A value below zero counts as zero, and one above 60 counts as 60. A value that is not a number is ignored. With [`CrossFade=`](/keys/crossfade/) set, a queued track uses the crossfade time instead; `FadeOut=` still applies to the other cases.
