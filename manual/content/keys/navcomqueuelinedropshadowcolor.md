The color applies only with [`NavComQueueLineDropShadow=yes`](/keys/navcomqueuelinedropshadow/). It colors the shadow below the queue lines and the border around each end square.

Write three numbers separated by commas. A value that does not begin with three such numbers keeps the default, and anything after the third number is ignored. A number outside 0 to 255 wraps around, so `300,0,0` is read as `44,0,0`.
