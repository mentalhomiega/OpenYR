With `TiberiumSpreads=no`, Tiberium cells still grow but never [spread](/systems/tiberium/#spread) onto neighboring cells. Blossom trees are not affected and still seed the ground around them; [other sources of Tiberium](/systems/tiberium/#other-sources-of-tiberium) covers them.

Only a single-player mission reads `[SpecialFlags]` from the map. Skirmish and multiplayer games always have this switch on.
