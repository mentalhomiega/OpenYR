  note: A height left out keeps the launch option's height, if any. If either dimension is still unset, both become 640 by 480.

The game reads this height with [`ScreenWidth`](/keys/screenwidth/#scope-client-settings-2) before it opens its window, and renders at the resulting size. That page covers how the pair combines with the launch option, the 640 by 480 fallback, and what happens when the renderer cannot start.

The height is the full height of the game screen. [The sidebar](/systems/sidebar/) runs down the whole of it, and the tactical view takes the height left below a 16-pixel strip across the top.
