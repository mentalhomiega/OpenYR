`TiberiumGrows=yes` makes Tiberium grow faster: after each growth pass, a type waits 30% of its [`Growth`](/keys/growth/) delay instead of the full delay. The [`Spread`](/keys/spread/#scope-tiberium) delay between spread passes is unchanged.

The switch does not decide whether Tiberium grows at all. With it off, growth runs at the full `Growth` delay. Among the map's switches, only [`TiberiumGrowthEnabled=no`](/keys/tiberiumgrowthenabled/) stops growth. A Tiberium type with [`GrowthPercentage=0`](/keys/growthpercentage/) never grows.

:::caution[The entry is read in campaigns only]
Only a single-player mission reads `[SpecialFlags]` from the map. A game against other machines always uses fast growth. A skirmish uses the full delay, unless a network match earlier in the same session turned fast growth on.
