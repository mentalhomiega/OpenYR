Above `0`, a destroyed vehicle stays on the map as a wreck. The destroying hit leaves it at one point of strength and unable to move. The wreck explodes and is removed once [`MaxDeathCounter`](/keys/maxdeathcounter/) game frames have passed. At `0` the destroying hit removes the vehicle at once.

Keep the value between `0` and `127`. The engine stores it in a single signed byte, so values from `128` to `256` wrap to zero or a negative number and turn the wreck off.

A vehicle that leaves a wreck skips the usual effects of destruction, both when it is destroyed and when the wreck later explodes:

- no "unit lost" announcement;
- no passengers escape;
- no crate drops, even with [`CarriesCrate=yes`](/keys/carriescrate/);
- no crew survivor appears, whatever [`CrewEscape`](/keys/crewescape/) holds.

The run has one set of frames for every facing, so the wreck plays the same frames whichever way the vehicle was pointing. It starts at [`StartDeathFrame`](/keys/startdeathframe/), advances one frame every [`DeathFrameRate`](/keys/deathframerate/) game frames, and holds its last frame once it gets there. Only shape artwork draws these frames. A [`Voxel=yes`](/keys/voxel/) vehicle with a value above `0` still becomes a wreck.

```ini title="art.ini"
[MYWALKER] ; the Image ID of a shape-drawn UnitType
Facings=8
WalkFrames=12
DeathFrames=13     ; one run of 13, from frame 8 × (0 + 12 + 1) = 104
DeathFrameRate=3   ; 39 game frames of animation, about two and a half seconds
MaxDeathCounter=64 ; the wreck is removed after 64 game frames
