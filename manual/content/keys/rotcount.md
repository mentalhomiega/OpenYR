key: RotCount
summary: Parsed rotation frame count that the engine never uses.
no_effect: true
see_also: ["Facings", "Turret"]
when_omitted:
  kind: context-dependent
  note: An AircraftType or UnitType section starts at 32 and an InfantryType section at 8. A BuildingType section is set to 32 when Turret=yes and to 1 otherwise, replacing whatever this key stored.

No drawing or targeting code reads the stored number. A shape-drawn vehicle takes its facing count from [`Facings`](/keys/facings/), and a voxel model is rotated to any facing instead of being drawn from a fixed set of frames.
