The animation draws `<Image ID>.SHP` when that file exists. If it does not, the animation falls back to `<AnimType ID>.SHP`, and if neither file exists it draws nothing. After a saved game is loaded there is no fallback, so an animation whose `<Image ID>.SHP` is missing draws nothing. An animation with [`DemandLoad=yes`](/keys/demandload/#scope-animtype) loads `<Image ID>.SHP` the first time it is needed and has no fallback.

An `Image=` that selects a different shape does not change the frame count; see [`End`](/keys/end/).

The theater settings treat this key differently:

- [`Theater=yes`](/keys/theater/#scope-animtype) names the artwork after the AnimType ID when the theater differs from the previous scenario's or a saved game is loaded. When the theater repeats, it uses the Image ID.
- [`NewTheater=yes`](/keys/newtheater/#scope-animtype) rewrites the theater letter in the name given here.
