```ini title="rules.ini"

VoiceSelect=MYTANK_Sel1,MYTANK_Sel2 ; sound IDs registered in SOUND.INI
```

When the player selects an object of this type, it speaks one entry picked at random from the list. The response is a sound without a place, so it does not fade or pan with the object's position on screen; see [Placed sounds](/systems/sound-effects/#placed-sounds). Only objects of a house the player controls speak.

Selecting several objects at once with a band box or a group key produces one response, from the first object selected. Three commands are the exception. A press of [`SelectType`](/commands/selecttype/), [`VeterancyFilter`](/commands/veterancyfilter/) or [`HealthFilter`](/commands/healthfilter/), or of a filter's add-lower form, can play one response for each object it adds to the selection. A filter press that only narrows the selection plays one response for each object it keeps.

## Writing the list

This section also applies to [`VoiceMove`](/keys/voicemove/), [`VoiceAttack`](/keys/voiceattack/), [`VoiceDie`](/keys/voicedie/) and [`VoiceFeedback`](/keys/voicefeedback/).

Each name is matched, without regard to letter case, against the sound IDs registered in [SOUND.INI](/formats/sound-ini/). A name that matches no sound is dropped. Do not put spaces after the commas: a name with a leading space matches nothing and is dropped.

A later rules file that sets the key replaces the earlier list. Writing the key with nothing after the `=` does not clear it, because the game ignores an empty assignment. To silence a type that an earlier file gave a list, write a value that matches no sound, such as `<none>`.
