Only the [Reveal around waypoint...](/mapping/actions/taction-reveal-some/) trigger action uses this value. The action uncovers the ground within this many cells of its waypoint for every human player who has not already been given full vision. A value above `10` uncovers ten cells, the most any sight scan reaches, and `0` uncovers nothing.

The reveal is centered on the waypoint's ground level, raised by the bridge height when the waypoint lies under a bridge. With [`RevealByHeight=yes`](/keys/revealbyheight/), cells behind high ground stay covered, so a waypoint at the foot of a cliff uncovers less than the radius names.
