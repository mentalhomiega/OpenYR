`FixedAlliance` has no effect in any game type. A locked alliance would disable the [`ToggleAlliance`](/commands/togglealliance/) command, which forms or breaks an alliance with the selected object's owner. That command works only outside single-player missions, and only a single-player mission reads this entry.

No game setup in OpenTS locks alliances either. Whether players can ally is decided by the game's alliance option.
