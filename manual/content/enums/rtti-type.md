The engine fixes this list of object kinds; rules files cannot add to it. In rules, only [`Factory`](/keys/factory/) takes one of these names, to set the kind of object a structure produces. That page lists the names that make a structure produce anything.

A `Factory` value that matches no name in the list, ignoring case, reads as `<none>`. A misspelled value therefore replaces any earlier setting with no kind at all.

Most names never appear in rules. Every object in play and every rules definition has a kind, which is why many names come in pairs: `Building` for a structure standing on the map, `BuildingType` for the rules entry it was made from. The rest cover engine objects such as map cells, production lines, the record a fogged cell keeps of what stood in it, and tunnel routes.
