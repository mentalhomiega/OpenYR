Each name stands for a fixed block of cells, and names are matched without regard to case. The numbers in a name are not read as dimensions. On a terrain object, and in a structure's Image ID entry, a name outside this list, such as `7x7`, counts as `1x1`. The entry named after a BuildingType ignores such a name, and [`Foundation`](/keys/foundation/#scope-buildingtype) covers how a structure's two art.ini entries combine.

A structure can use all twenty-two names. A terrain object has a block of cells only for the first eight, and on a terrain object `3x5` is a four-by-two block. [`Foundation`](/keys/foundation/#scope-terraintype) covers what the other names do there.
