# Manual style

Write for readers making configuration or maintenance decisions. Keep the page
to behavior that catalogs and frontmatter do not already show, and write it so
each sentence lands in one pass. A sentence that must be read twice is a
defect, however short it is. This guide adds to the repository
[writing rules](../AGENTS.md#writing-prose), which apply here in full.

[Veterancy and promotion](content/systems/veterancy.md) is the current model
for a system page: the result first, one job to a paragraph, and the mechanism
left on the page that owns it.

## Audience and voice

Modder-facing pages may assume familiarity with Tiberian Sun INI syntax,
ObjectType IDs, and FinalSun terminology. Define OpenTS-specific behavior and
invariants. Internals pages may assume C++ and repository knowledge, but must
still define OpenTS ownership and compatibility boundaries.

Use terms familiar to the Tiberian Sun modding community. Add the exact engine
identifier where it helps. Preserve the spelling and case of keys, IDs, enum
tokens, filenames, command strings, and C++ symbols. Use American English and
sentence case for headings and labels.

Prefer plain terms to C++ class names. Write vehicle, infantry, aircraft, and
structure rather than `UnitClass`, `InfantryClass`, `AircraftClass`, and
`BuildingClass`. If a broad term is ambiguous, list the kinds it covers;
"unit" alone is ambiguous in this game's vocabulary. Define a term on the page
unless it recurs across many pages and has no short synonym, in which case link
the [glossary](site/src/content/docs/glossary.md).

Use present-tense, declarative sentences. Lead with the result, then give its
condition. Replace vague words such as "safe," "normal," "available," and
"works" with the exact condition or result. Where a setting can be written
wrongly, give the instruction rather than the diagnosis: "keep `VeteranRatio`
above `0`" serves the reader better than an account of the missing guard.
Avoid marketing, personification, and editorial status.

Name an operation with the word the engine and the page already use for it.
Mounting, caching, loading, reading, and writing are distinct operations, and a
verb chosen for tone in place of one of them hides which one ran. Reuse an
established verb's grammar as well as the verb: "answers for a name" does not
license a bare "answers." Where no engine term applies, a plain "is" beats an
elevated substitute.

Describe the engine and its inputs, not how the manual was produced. Do not
label public material as generated, extracted, authored, or contract-backed.
The site may carry one brief notice about AI assistance and possible errors;
do not repeat it on individual pages.

## Canonical terms

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Section | A bracketed INI heading such as `[GAPOWR]` |
| Key | The name to the left of `=` |
| Value | The text to the right of `=` |
| Assignment | The complete `Key=Value` line |
| ObjectType ID | A rules identifier for a type definition |
| Runtime instance | An object created from a type and present in the scenario |
| Image ID | An art identifier selected by an assignment such as `Image=` |
| TypeClass | A C++ type-definition class; use only in developer-facing prose |

Keep type-definition state, runtime-instance state, and global or scenario
state distinct. Link the first useful mention of an engine-specific concept to
its main explanation when the link helps the reader.

### Ambiguous terms

Use these terms only in the stated sense. Check each use against its own code
path; do not copy wording from a nearby page or make a global replacement.

| Term | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Mover, foot object | Name the actual kinds of object. [`CloseEnough`](content/keys/closeenough.md), for example, applies to infantry, walkers, hovercraft, and driven vehicles. |
| Leaves the map | An object literally exits across the map edge. If it is destroyed, sold, or otherwise removed from play, write "taken off the map," as in [Laser fences](content/systems/laser-fences.md). |
| Full strength | A team's requested roster count, as defined in [AI triggers and team production](content/systems/ai-team-production.md). Use "undamaged" or "maximum strength" for hit points and "full brightness" for lighting. |
| Slot | Always qualify it at first use: difficulty slot, weapon slot, cameo slot, upgrade slot, Tiberium slot, or landing slot. |
| Score | Points. Use "music" or "music track" for the other sense. |
| Under way | A team has started. Use "moving" for motion. |
| Converter, drawer | Do not use these C++ names as reader terms. Name the cell tint table, terrain tile renderer, or shape renderer meant by the code. For example, describe a cell's tint table as "the same tinted terrain palette as the ground beneath it." |

### The key test for a reader term

The bans above are instances of a general test. Before using an engine word in prose, ask whether
an INI key a modder types carries it.

"Door" passes for a structure: `DoorAnim`, `DoorStages` and `UnderDoorAnim` are art.ini keys, so a
factory door is the reader's own word. It fails for a vehicle, where no key names one and the word
is really a shared internal timer covering gates, factories, aircraft and vehicles alike. Where a
mechanism needs a name and no key carries one, use a plain word the page defines.

Apply the test to `Converter`, `drawer`, `Delay`, `Fuse`, `Flasher` and `Cargo` the same way: each
is an engine helper whose name is a reader term only where a key uses it.

### Map regions

A scenario declares two different regions of cells. Use only these names:

| Name | Declared by | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The playfield | `[Map] Size=` | Every cell the map has. Nothing can stand, path, or be revealed outside it. |
| The playable area | `[Map] LocalSize=` | The smaller region that the player can see, scroll to, and play in. The engine clips and insets it within the playfield; the remaining ring is the map border. |

Both regions are diamonds on the cell grid, not rectangles. The map rectangle
is a third region: the upright square of cells enclosing the playfield, used
for scanning and iteration. Define it wherever it appears.

Do not use "playable diamond," "visible area," "local map area," "local radar
area," or "scenario's declared playable area." "Playable" belongs to the
smaller region, while "visible" conflicts with shroud and fog terminology.

Never rename these regions by find and replace. Existing prose has used
"playable area" for both. Trace each claim: crates are placed in the playable
area but may be collected anywhere in the playfield; a search may be allowed
by the playable area and then scan the playfield; guarding units may survive
to the playfield while other objects are removed at the playable-area edge.

## Summaries and structure

Write `summary` as one short, literal description of the page's behavior or
purpose. It appears as the subtitle and search description, so do not repeat it
in the opening paragraph or write it as a teaser.

State a value or effect directly. For a value, write "The WeaponType in the
object type's first weapon slot," not "Names the WeaponType in the first weapon
slot." For behavior, write "Marks a map as one that shipped with the game."
Prefer wording that remains true if another scope is added later.

Use headings for structure, not decoration. Use H2 for a topic and H3 for its
phases, cases, or variants. A short page may need no headings. Do not pad a
simple entity to fit a template.

If a system page depends on an entity with its own vocabulary, open with one
clearly headed section that defines the entity, the few fields used by the
mechanic, and one short example. Readers who already know it should be able to
skip the section. Do not explain unrelated vocabulary.

Define a term of art in the sentence that first uses it. Terms such as full
strength, autocreate, stray distance, and team origin look like ordinary
English but have specific meanings.

For a runtime decision, describe only the order, accepted and rejected paths,
fallback, and result that affect use. Name a known crash, deletion,
desynchronization, collateral effect, or cleanup path instead of saying that
the operation fails.

Use a structured list for a condition with three or more terms or any nesting.
Label groups "All of," "Any of," or "None of," indent their terms, and keep the
engine's test order.

### Locatable is not writable

A page can name exactly the right key, in the right file, in the right section, and still leave
the reader unable to write it. Where a page names a key the reader sets, it states the accepted
values, the file and section, and what the key does when absent — or links the page that renders
them. Naming the key alone is not enough.

The two halves belong to different owners. Values and defaults live on the key page, which renders
them from structured fields. Prose states what the key does, including which direction a value
moves the behavior, which no rendered field says. Do not copy the values into prose to save the
reader a click; link them instead.

## Examples

Use the smallest concrete input that clarifies a non-obvious syntax, scope,
interaction, unit, or outcome.

- Give each INI fence a useful file title.
- Use exact keys and realistic values instead of pseudo-syntax when possible.
- Define synthetic IDs and all IDs they reference, preferably with a short
  inline comment.
- Say when an example omits required surrounding configuration.
- Explain only fields and results that the reference does not already make
  clear.
- State what the example produces. Label a value as an example where it could
  pass for a default.
- Call a value a default, recommendation, or canonical choice only when the
  evidence supports that claim.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[GAPOWR]
BaseNormal=no
Adjacent=5
```

An example shows input shape; it does not prove that a runtime result was
observed. Examples must not require proprietary assets or original executables
to understand.

### Composition is not restatement

A page documenting several settings that are written together — a system rather than a single
key — may show them in one fence beside each other:

```ini title="rules.ini"
[GAPOWR]
BaseNormal=no  ; this structure cannot anchor later placements
Adjacent=5     ; how far a pending structure of this type searches for one
```

No key page can show this, because each owns one key and its rendered specification block names
only its own file, section and type. The fence is the composition.

It is not a place to repeat what those key pages render. Leave out accepted values, defaults,
omission records, and any per-key list of files or sections; link the key instead. `Keep one
source of truth` below still governs.

Without such a fence, a reader finishes a page about a system holding a settings table and no
way to write the file. That is the failure this section exists to prevent.

## Markdown vocabulary

Prefer ordinary Markdown:

- inline code for keys, values, IDs, filenames, sections, and expressions;
- titled fenced blocks for INI, serialized records, and necessary source;
- short lists and tables for real steps, choices, or mappings;
- Starlight asides only when the information needs to interrupt the page.

Use `note` for necessary context, `tip` for a source-supported or tested recipe,
`caution` for an easy misconfiguration or surprising exception, and `danger`
for a demonstrated crash, corruption, desynchronization, or compatibility
risk. A danger aside states the input and the outcome. Title an aside with its
topic or the action it asks for rather than a verdict on the engine, and do not
raise a severity for emphasis.

Avoid raw HTML, MDX-only widgets, one-off components, empty paragraphs, and
callouts used only for visual hierarchy. Put recurring presentation in shared
Astro components and CSS.

Write each paragraph of a page or a change record as one line and let the
editor wrap it. Hard-wrapping prose to a column makes a later edit reflow
lines it did not touch.

## Keep one source of truth

Do not repeat facts rendered from structured metadata: omission and no-effect
records, command fields, scripting value lists, format fields, accepted-key
selectors, source-file lists, or typed relationships. Prose may explain why a
fact matters, but it must not maintain another copy of the same data.

State current behavior without routine verification hedges or compatibility
promises. If the evidence is incomplete, narrow or omit the claim. Add a local
qualification only when the uncertainty changes the reader's decision.

## Worked examples

These pairs show how much a hard passage usually has to change. Their facts
were checked against the source when they were written; check your own page's
facts rather than copying these.

### Explain the outcome of an operation

Before:

> The chosen vehicle is created for the collector's house in limbo and taken
> out of it onto the crate cell, or onto a nearby cell its speed type can
> occupy. Once the vehicle is placed, on either cell, the collector is refused
> the crate cell for that move and stops short of it. If neither placement
> succeeds the vehicle is deleted and money is paid instead; outside a
> campaign that payout uses the Unit row's third field, not the Money row's.

Splitting this into shorter sentences, such as "The vehicle is created in
limbo. The engine then places it," still walks the reader through the engine's
sequence. After:

> The reward vehicle appears on the crate's cell or a nearby cell it can
> occupy. The collector stops short of the crate's cell when the reward
> vehicle is placed.
>
> If the vehicle cannot be placed in either location, the player receives
> money instead. Outside campaigns, this payout uses the third field of the
> `Unit` entry in `[Powerups]`.

The result, the effect on the collector, and the fallback remain; creation and
deletion go. A separate failure needs its own check: when no vehicle type is
eligible, the crate gives neither a vehicle nor money, so "if the unit reward
fails, you get money" would be false.

### Turn a crash diagnosis into an instruction

Before:

> The attack animation must resolve and declare itself. VeinAttack has no
> built-in value. With the setting unresolved, the first time a vulnerable
> object and mature flat vein meet in the same cell, the cell builds an
> animation from a null type and faults. That happens whether the object
> arrives or the vein ripens under it. The animation type must also set
> IsVeins=yes in art.ini. Without it the animation plays as ordinary art and
> deals nothing, and it never releases the cell's attack slot, so that cell
> can never be triggered again.

After:

> Set `VeinAttack` to a valid animation type. If it is missing, the game
> crashes when veins first attack, including when veins mature beneath an
> object.
>
> Set `IsVeins=yes` in that animation's `art.ini` section. Otherwise the
> animation deals no vein damage and prevents further vein attacks in that
> cell.

Title such a warning with its topic or action, such as "Configure the vein
attack animation," and keep the links to the keys that give their file,
section, and values. The reader needs the missing setting and the crash, not
the null pointer.

### Give separate rules separate paragraphs

A long warning about `[Powerups]` can mix four facts: omitted results get zero
weight, a four-entry example therefore disables every other result, the entry
names live on another page, and an all-zero table can crash the game. Put the
configuration rule beside the example:

> Include every result you want to keep in `[Powerups]`. Results omitted from
> the section receive zero weight, so this example disables all results
> except the four shown. See the crate-result reference for the entry names.

Give the crash its own warning:

> Keep the total result weight above zero. If all weights are zero,
> collecting a crate outside a campaign can crash the game.

### Replace figurative wording with the consequence

- "The field takes nothing off anything" becomes "The attack animation plays,
  but deals no vein damage."
- "The queue of cells waiting for its attention" becomes "The queue of cells
  to process." Keep the queue only when the reader needs its order or limit.
- "The capacity is the engine's own figure rather than an artifact of any
  shipped file" becomes "Set `WeedCapacity` above `0`; otherwise unloaded
  weeds are discarded."

Use the same clear term each time. Do not swap a technical term for a metaphor
or a longer synonym.

### Keep the qualification that makes a formula true

Before:

> Both figures in the fraction are priced through the house that lost the
> object. The victim's value is its own type's price scaled by that house's
> multipliers, and the killer's cost is its type's price scaled by those same
> multipliers. The killer's own house is never asked.

After:

> Both costs use the defeated owner's cost multipliers. Applying the same
> multiplier to both costs leaves their ratio unchanged, except that each
> cost is rounded down to whole credits. The attacker's own cost multipliers
> are ignored.

The rewrite keeps whose multipliers apply and the rounding, and drops the
account of how the calculation gets its inputs. Shortening it further to
"price multipliers never affect experience" would be false.

### Keep the condition when simplifying an outcome

Too broad:

> A harvested cell owned by a live monster rejoins that monster's growth
> queue.

Only a cell that keeps thin vein can be queued again. Clear:

> If harvesting leaves thin vein, the live monster can queue the cell to grow
> again, subject to its growth limits. Harvesting that removes the vein
> clears ownership and does not requeue the cell.

The missing condition is the defect even though the sentence has no "always."
Do not replace it with a vague "usually" or "may."

A promise that something survives must hold through cleanup as well. Too
broad:

> Veins that another monster owns stay on the map.

Clear:

> When the monster is removed, cleanup clears vein overlays throughout its
> central five-by-five block. This includes veins owned by another monster.

### Separate the cases in a dense paragraph

A chemical missile explanation can hold three separate facts: with
`ManualControl=yes`, filling the weed pool starts the countdown; another full
pool restarts an unfinished countdown; and a ready weapon leaves the full pool
waiting. Give the trigger and what it consumes first, the restart in the next
paragraph, and the ready weapon separately, or compare the cases in a small
table. Keep each case's condition with it.
