Each factory of a category past the first now multiplies that category's build times by `MultipleFactory` in `[General]` of `rules.ini`: at `0.8`, two factories build in about 80% of the time and three in about 64%. Before, the build time was divided once by `(factories - 1) × MultipleFactory`. At `1` a second factory gave no discount and a third halved build times, and below `1` a second factory lengthened them. The stock rules set `MultipleFactory=0`, which still gives no discount.

`MultipleFactoryCap` in the same section limits how many factories count toward the discount.

CCHyper is credited for the Vinifera version this follows, dkeeton for the ts-patches port of the Red Alert 2 formula, and Krnyoshi for the fix to Vinifera's cap.
