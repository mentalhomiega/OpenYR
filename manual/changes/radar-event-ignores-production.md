Goto Radar Event no longer jumps to the factory that a finished vehicle, infantryman or aircraft has just left. Each one leaving used to move the place the command jumps to, replacing the attack or loss the player wanted to find. In a multiplayer game, another player's finished objects moved it as well, to that player's factory.

dkeeton is credited for the ts-patches change this follows, and Rampastring for the same change in Vinifera.
