The game window, its events, and keyboard and mouse input now go through SDL 3. The window opens at the same size and place, saved hotkeys keep their keys, and the pointer keeps its artwork and scale.

Tapping Alt or F10 no longer puts the window's system menu into keyboard mode, and Alt+Space no longer opens that menu.

A game played in a window can now be dragged onto another display or partly off the screen. It used to be held inside the primary display.

The game no longer reserves Ctrl+Alt+Shift+M for itself, so other programs can use that shortcut.

While the game window has the focus, the display no longer turns off after the system's idle time. The screen saver was already kept from starting.

When the game window or the renderer cannot start, or the game cannot use its data or user directory, the message now shows an error icon in place of a warning icon.

The question at startup about critically low disk space now shows a warning icon in place of a question mark. Its Yes and No buttons now use the game's language; they used to use the language of Windows. Pressing Escape in it now answers No, so the game exits, where it used to do nothing.

The display options screen now lists the desktop's current resolution even when Windows leaves it out of the display's modes, provided it is between 640 by 400 and 4096 by 4096 pixels. A resolution the display offers only with 256 colors or fewer is no longer listed.

In-game chat, the high-score name and the older dialogs' text boxes now take the characters the keyboard layout types, including accents typed with a dead key and text from an input method.

The keyboard options screen names a key by the character the layout prints on it, or by an English name such as `Home` for a key that prints none. It used to show the names Windows gives in its own language.
