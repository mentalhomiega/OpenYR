A single-player mission or a skirmish is now held to 60 frames a second at Faster, then 45, 30, 20, 15 and 10 at the slower speeds, with Fastest still unlimited. It used to run at 62.5 at Faster and at 31.25, 20.8, 15.6, 12.5 and 10.4 below it. Missions count frames, so only their length in real time changes.

Every game now holds its rate exactly. Each frame's wait used to be rounded down to whole milliseconds, so a network game at 60 ran at 62.5.

A network game now keeps its full rate in the background, minimized or not, without keeping a processor core busy. It used to wait an extra 10 milliseconds each frame, so a game at 45 frames a second fell to about 31. A solo game kept running by `SimulateWhileUnfocused=yes` under `[Options]` in `sun.ini` keeps the same full rate.

Rampastring is credited for the ts-patches change whose single-player speed table this uses.
