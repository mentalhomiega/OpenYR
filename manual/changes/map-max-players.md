A multiplayer map's `MaxPlayers` field now fills the largest number of players the map declares. Both places that read it asked for `MinPlayers` instead, so a listing's ceiling always came out equal to its floor. A map could not declare that it accepted more players than it required. Neither count is enforced: nothing reads them once the listing is built, so this settles what a map declares rather than how many players may join it.
