Ordering a large group about discarded the orders past the sixty-fourth without saying so, and left the rest of the group standing where it was. Orders wait in a queue until the frame that sends them, and that queue held sixty-four. It now grows to hold as many orders as are given at once, so every vehicle and infantry unit in a selection carries out the order it is given.

A network or internet game no longer ends with a data queue overflow. Orders arriving from the other players wait in a second list, which held four thousand and ninety-six. A player busy enough to fill it was dropped out of the game with that message.
