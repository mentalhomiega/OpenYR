A plain click on the ground with a vehicle, infantry or aircraft factory selected now sets its rally point, where it used to do nothing. The force-move key, which used to set the rally point, now does nothing on a factory that cannot pack up.

On a factory that can pack up, such as Firestorm's mobile war factory, the plain click used to pack it up and now sets the rally point. The force-move key packs it up instead.

`AltToRally=yes` under `[Options]` in `sun.ini` restores the old controls for the player who sets it.

AlexB is credited for the ts-patches option this follows.
