title: Define sounds with the Yuri's Revenge SOUND.INI keys
category: feature
release: 0.2.0
breaking: true
migration:
- A `Volume=` above 1 is now a percentage, so a value that used to boost a sound beyond its sample now quietens it. Remove such values or write `Volume=100`.

A sound's section in `SOUND.INI` can now list several samples under `Sounds=`, play them at random or in order, loop them, and add attack and decay samples. It can also wait between cycles, vary pitch and volume at random, limit how many copies play at once, and set how far from the view it can be heard. `[Defaults]` supplies any key a section leaves out, and `Channels=` under `[General]` sets how many sound effects can play at once.

`Priority=` now also accepts the Yuri's Revenge names such as `HIGH`, and a `Volume=` above 1 is read as a percentage, so sections written for Yuri's Revenge play as intended. The shipped files set no `Volume=` and play as before.

CCHyper is credited for the Vinifera additions to the Yuri's Revenge keys that this follows: the `SEQUENTIAL` and `QUEUE` controls and the `SHROUDED` and `UNSHROUDED` types.
