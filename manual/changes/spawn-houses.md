Vehicle, infantry, aircraft, and structure rows, trigger definitions, and TeamTypes may now be owned by `Spawn1` through `Spawn8` or `<Player @ A>` through `<Player @ H>`. Each spelling names whoever starts at that numbered position. Trigger and team mission house parameters accept the same positions as `50` through `57` or `4475` through `4482`. Start positions are assigned as the scenario loads, before those records are read. A spawn house nobody holds names no house: its object rows are skipped, its triggers are deleted, and its TeamTypes create no team.

Iran is credited for the CnCNet spawner houses this follows and Rampastring for the later fixes to them.
